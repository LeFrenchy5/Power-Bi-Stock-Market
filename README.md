# Power-Bi-Stock-Market

This project is my first step into using Power Bi
The database used is a very simple stock market excel sheet, which is a monthly report rather than a daily one.

The idea behind this project was to use an easy database, so that i could learn all the ins and outs of Power Bi.
This includes filters, slicers , multiple graphs and calculations.
