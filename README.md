# Power-Bi-Stock-Market

This project is my first step into using Power Bi to create a dashboard. The idea behind this project was to use an easy database (stocks), so that i could learn all the ins and outs of Power Bi.
This includes filters, slicers , multiple graphs and calculations.

The database used is a very simple stock market excel sheet, which is a monthly report rather than a daily one. Providing dividends, open, close values, the ticker and the industry for each stock. The database is definetly not useable to get great insights into each stock as the data is to irregular to get patterns.

<h4>Improve:</h4> Places for me to improve when using Power Bi, is font and colour schemes, need to be designed better to be more pleasing to the eye. More complex calculations need to be used to get a deeper understanding of the data at hand. The size and positioning of the graphs need to be more eye catching and give an easier picture to the insights of the data.
